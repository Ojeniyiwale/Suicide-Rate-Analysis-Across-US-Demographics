# Suicide-Rate-Analysis-Across-US-Demographics
This project presents a demographic-based analysis of suicide rates in the United States using Power BI. It transforms raw statistical data into an interactive dashboard that reveals high-risk groups, time-based trends, and provides data-backed recommendations.

📁 Project Summary

Goal: Analyze suicide rates across age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin.

Tool: Microsoft Power BI (with Power Query and DAX)

Dataset: Official U.S. public health statistics on suicide rates

📊 Key Features

Summary KPIs: Total, Average, Max, Min suicide rates

Visuals:

Line charts for demographic trends

Bar charts by age group and unit type

Donut chart by year distribution

Slicer-enabled filtering by demographics

🔍 Insights

Highest risk observed in ages 15–44

Suicide rates spike among combined demographic groups (Sex + Age + Race)

Significant rate clustering in certain years

One unit dominates dataset (Deaths per 100,000)

📌 A Hidden Insight: The "All Ages" Category

One of the most surprising insights came from a group labeled "All Ages", which appeared 1,422 times in the dataset. While this group wasn't age-specific, it likely includes aggregated or unspecified records — a reminder that not all data fits neatly into boxes. It reinforces the need for caution when interpreting trends and highlights the importance of complete, well-categorized data collection.

✅ Recommendations

Focus mental health programs on young adults (15–44)

Disaggregate data by intersectional groups for better intervention targeting

Normalize unit values in visuals

Use tooltip and numeric sorting for clarity
